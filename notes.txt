1. we need to create a development environment

for windows:
    1.1. py -m venv ven
    1.2. .\Scripts\activate

for linux:
    1.1. python3 -m venv venv
    1.2. source venv/bin/activate

2. Install Django framework:
    2. pip install django

3. Create a project with django:
    3. django-admin startproject project_name

4. Inicialize git and use "touch" to avoid push .venv folder to the github repository
    4.1. git init
    4.2. touch .gitignore

5. Run server (we need to be into the app folder):
    5. py manage.py runserver

6. Project and apps in Django:
    Django names project like a container of multiples apps, one app is just functionality of our project:
    Example:
    Instagram = Project
    Feed = app
    Stories = app
    Messages = app

7. To create a new app into a our project, we need to type the next code in our terminal
    7. Into a project folder: py manage.py startapp name_of_the_app

8. For each app, we need to define its urls.py file wherein it includes throghout path() function. 
    Also, we have to include the path of our new urls.py file for each app into our main urls.py 
    file (main directory)
